# We All Rise
A decentralized container hosting service framework

This would take container images (Docker for now) and be able to run them on a hosting service in exchange for buying and spending currency.  This project is only the framework contract for the hosting service, along with it's transaction system.  People could use this to buy into a hosting service that avoids heavy fees, pay into it by using computing power, and without always having to have that computer turned onon. It would be completely anonymous although it's hosted on the surface web.

Built with ERC721 non-fungible token specifications.
